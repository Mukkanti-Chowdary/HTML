A div (short for division) is a block-level element that is often used as a container for other HTML elements. 
A span is an inline element, which means it takes up only as much width as necessary and is typically used for small chunks of HTML inside a line of text.

code:<!DOCTYPE html>

			#outer-div{
				color:blue;

		<div id="outer-div">
